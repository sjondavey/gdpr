These measures should be integrated into both the design specifications of the technology and organisational practices (Reference: 1, 3).\\n\\n2. **Lawfulness of Processing**: The processing of personal data through video surveillance must be legally permissible.

Member States may also introduce specific national legislation to adapt the application of GDPR rules (Reference: 2).\\n\\n3. **Technical and Organisational Measures**: Controllers must secure personal data adequately, proportional to the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. This includes ensuring system and data confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and implementing measures to safeguard all data-protection principles during processing.
