In practice, this  means that a supervisory authority would contact the representative in connection with any matter  relating to the compliance obligations of a controller or processor established outside the Union, and  the representative shall be able to facilitate any informational or procedural exchange between a  requesting supervisory authority and a controller or processor established outside the Union.  \n",
      "With the help of a team if necessary, the representative in the Union must therefore be in a position  to efficiently communicate with data subjects and cooperate with the supervisory authorities  concerned. This means that this communication should in principle take place in the language or  languages used by the supervisory authorities and the data subjects concerned or, should this result  in a disproportionate effort, that other means and techniques shall be used by the representative in  order to ensure the effectiveness of communication. The availability of a representative is therefore  essential in order to ensure that data subjects and supervisory authorities will be able to establish  contact easily with the non-EU controller or processor. In line with Recital 80 and Article 27(5), the  designation of a representative in the Union does not affect the responsibility and liability of the  controller or of the processor under the GDPR and shall be without prejudice to legal actions which  could be initiated against the controller or the processor themselves. The GDPR does not establish a substitutive liability of the representative in place of the controller or processor it represents in the  Union.  \n",
      "It should however be noted that the concept of the representative was introduced precisely with the  aim of facilitating the liaison with and ensuring effective enforcement of the GDPR against controllers  or processors that fall under Article 3(2) of the GDPR. To this end, it was the intention to enable  supervisory authorities to initiate enforcement proceedings through the representative designated by  the controllers or processors not established in the Union. This includes the possibility for supervisory  authorities to address corrective measures or administrative fines and penalties imposed on the  controller or processor not established in the Union to the representative, in accordance with articles  58(2) and 83 of the GDPR. The possibility to hold a representative directly liable is however limited to  its direct obligations referred to in articles 30 and article 58(1) a of the GDPR  \n",
      "The EDPB furthermore highlights that article 50 of the GDPR notably aims at facilitating the  enforcement of legislation in relation to third countries and international organisation, and that the  development of further international cooperation mechanisms in this regard is currently being  considered.\n",

Additionally, it covers processing by entities not based in the Union but in places where Member State law applies due to public international law.\n",

      "- Where possible, a description of the technical and organisational security measures you have in place.\n",
      "Processors acting on your behalf must keep similar records for the activities they carry out, including their and your contact details, the processing they perform for you, any data transfers to third countries or international organisations and their security measures.\n",
      "These records must be in written form, which can include electronic formats, and you must make them available to the supervisory authority upon request.\n",
      "If your organisation employs fewer than 250 persons, you are exempt from these requirements unless your data processing is likely to risk individuals' rights and freedoms, is not occasional, or involves special categories of data or criminal conviction and offence data.\n",
      "-- You, the processor, and any representatives must cooperate with the supervisory authority when asked to help it do its job.\n",
      "-- You must implement technical and organisational measures to ensure data security, considering factors like the current technology, implementation costs, processing nature, scope, context, purposes, and risk to individuals' rights and freedoms. Measures may include data pseudonymisation and encryption, ensuring processing systems' confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience, restoring data access after incidents, and regularly testing the measures' effectiveness. The security level should reflect processing risks, especially concerning data loss, destruction, alteration, unauthorised access or disclosure. Demonstrating compliance can involve adhering to approved codes of conduct or certification mechanisms. Also, ensure that anyone under your or your processor's authority only processes personal data on your instructions unless the law requires otherwise.\n",
      "-- If there is a personal data breach, you must notify the supervisory authority promptly and, if possible, within 72 hours of becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to pose a risk to individuals' rights and freedoms. If notification exceeds 72 hours, explain the reasons for the delay. Processors must inform you immediately upon detecting a breach. The notification must detail the breach's nature, including the categories and approximate numbers of individuals and records affected, provide contact information of your data protection officer or another contact point, outline the likely consequences, and describe the actions you have taken or propose to take to address the breach and any measures to lessen its effects. If all information cannot be provided at once, it should be delivered in phases without unnecessary delay. Document all breaches, including their facts, effects, and remedial actions taken to allow the supervisory authority to check your compliance with this article.\n",
      "-- When a personal data breach might significantly affect individuals' rights and freedoms, you must notify those affected without unnecessary delay. The notification must be straightforward and contain specifics on the breach's nature. However, you don't need to notify individuals if:\n",
      "1. You've applied adequate security measures that make the affected personal data inaccessible or unreadable to unauthorised persons, such as encryption.\n",
      "2. You've taken steps after the breach to ensure that the high risk to individuals' rights and freedoms is no longer likely.\n",
      "3. Informing each individual would require an unreasonably high effort, in which case a public announcement or similar broad-reaching communication must be made.\n",
      "If you haven't informed the affected individuals, the supervisory authority will assess the risk level of the breach. It can either require you to notify the individuals or agree that one of the above exceptions applies.\n",
      "-- Before starting any processing activities that use new technologies and are likely to pose a high risk to individuals' rights and freedoms, you must conduct a data protection impact assessment (DPIA). This is particularly mandatory for:\n",
      "- Automated processing including profiling that significantly affects individuals.\n",
      "- Large-scale processing of special categories of data or data concerning criminal convictions.\n",
      "- Systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale.\n",
      "You should consult your data protection officer when conducting this assessment. The assessment must include a systematic description of the processing operations and their purposes, an evaluation of necessity and proportionality, a risk assessment to individuals’ rights and freedoms, and the measures to address these risks including safeguards and compliance mechanisms.\n",
      "You should also consider any relevant approved codes of conduct to evaluate the impact of your processing operations. Where appropriate, take into account the views of the affected individuals or their representatives on the intended processing, ensuring this does not harm commercial or public interests or the security of processing operations.\n",
      "If the processing has a legal basis in Union or Member State law, and a data protection impact assessment has already been part of a general impact assessment under that law, you may not need to conduct another assessment unless considered necessary by the Member State.\n",
      "Whenever there’s a change in the risk posed by the processing operations, reassess the processing to ensure alignment with the initial data protection impact assessment.\n",
      "-- You must consult the supervisory authority before processing if a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) shows that the processing could result in a high risk without measures to mitigate it. If the supervisory authority believes the planned processing would breach the regulation, especially if risks are not properly identified or mitigated, they must provide written advice within up to eight weeks, extendable by six weeks for complex cases. They'll inform you of any extension and reasons within one month. During consultation, you must give the supervisory authority information about processing responsibilities, purposes, means, measures to protect individuals' rights, contact details of the data protection officer, the impact assessment, and any other requested information. Member States must consult the supervisory authority when preparing legislative or regulatory measures related to processing. Additionally, Member State laws may require you to get prior authorisation from the supervisory authority for processing related to public interest tasks, including social protection and public health.\n",
      "-- You must appoint a data protection officer (DPO) if you're a public authority or body (excluding courts acting in their judicial capacity), if your core activities require regular and systematic monitoring of individuals on a large scale, or if you process special categories of data or personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences on a large scale. A group of undertakings can appoint a single DPO as long as they are easily accessible from each establishment. Public authorities or bodies can also designate a single DPO across multiple authorities or bodies, considering their organisation and size. Even if not required by the criteria, you or associations representing you may appoint a DPO; this appointment can be mandatory as specified by Union or Member State law. The DPO must be chosen for their expert knowledge of data protection law and practices. They can be an employee or work under a service contract. You must publish and communicate the DPO's contact details to the supervisory authority.\n",
      "-- You must involve your data protection officer (DPO) promptly in all matters related to personal data protection. Support your DPO by providing necessary resources for their tasks, including access to personal data and processing operations, and help maintain their knowledge. Ensure your DPO can carry out their duties without interference, and they cannot be dismissed or penalised for performing their tasks. They must report directly to your highest management level. Individuals can contact the DPO about any issues related to their personal data processing or their rights. Your DPO must keep information confidential, as required by law. The DPO can have other responsibilities, provided they don't lead to a conflict of interest.\n",
      "-- Your data protection officer (DPO) must perform the following tasks:\n",
      "- Inform and advise you, your processors, and relevant employees about their obligations under GDPR and other relevant data protection laws.\n",
      "- Monitor compliance with GDPR, other data protection laws, and your data protection policies. This includes assigning responsibilities, training staff involved in processing personal data, and conducting audits.\n",
      "- Provide advice regarding data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) and oversee their implementation.\n",
      "- Cooperate with the data protection authority.\n",
      "- Serve as the point of contact for the data protection authority for processing-related issues, including prior consultations, and consult on any other relevant matters.\n",
      "The DPO must consider the risk associated with processing activities, taking into account the types of personal data handled, processing scope, context, and purposes.\n"
