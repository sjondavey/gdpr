They should make such documentation available to the competent SAs upon request. <br>The BCR-C should oblige any BCR member acting as data importer to promptly notify the data exporter if, when using these BCR-C as a tool for transfers, and for the duration of the BCR membership, it has reasons to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices that would prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under the BCR-C, including following a change in the laws in the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request). This information should also be provided to the Liable BCR member(s). <br>Upon verification of such notification, the BCR member acting as data exporter, along with the Liable BCR member(s) and the relevant Privacy officer or Function, should commit to promptly identify supplementary measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the BCR member acting as data exporter and/or data importer, in order to enable them to fulfil their obligations under the BCR-C. The same applies if a BCR member acting as data exporter has reasons to believe that a BCR member acting as its data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under this BCR-C. <br>Where the BCR member acting as data exporter, along with the Liable BCR member(s) and the relevant Privacy officer or Function, assesses that the BCR-C – even if accompanied by supplementary measures – cannot be complied with for a transfer or set of transfers, or if instructed by the Competent SAs, it commits to suspend the transfer or set of transfers at stake, as well as all transfers for which the same assessment and reasoning would lead to a similar result, until compliance is again ensured or the transfer is ended. <br>The BCR-C should contain a commitment that following such a suspension, the BCR member acting as data exporter has to end the transfer or set of transfers if the BCR C cannot be complied with and compliance with the BCR is not restored within one month of suspension. In this case, personal data that have been transferred prior to the suspension, and any copies thereof, should, at the choice of the BCR member acting as data exporter, be returned to it or destroyed in their entirety. <br>The BCR-C should contain a commitment that the Liable BCR member(s) and the relevant Privacy officer or Function will inform all other BCR members of the assessment carried out and of its results, so that the identified supplementary measures will be applied in case the same type of transfers is carried out by any other BCR member or, where effective supplementary measures could not be put in place, the transfers at stake are suspended or ended. <br>The BCR-C needs to include a duty for data exporters to monitor, on an ongoing basis, and where appropriate in collaboration with data importers, developments in the third countries to which the data exporters have transferred personal data that could affect the initial assessment of the level of protection and the decisions taken accordingly on such transfers.\n",

       "[^26]: As regards the impact of such laws and practices on compliance with the BCR, different elements may be considered as part of an overall assessment. Such elements may include relevant and documented practical experience with prior instances of requests for disclosure from public authorities, or the absence of such requests, covering a sufficiently representative time-frame. This refers in particular to internal records or other documentation, drawn up on a continuous basis in accordance with due diligence and certified at senior management level, provided that this information can be lawfully shared with third parties. Where this practical experience is relied upon to conclude that the data importer will not be prevented from complying with the BCR, it needs to be supported by other relevant, objective elements, and it is for the BCR members to consider carefully whether these elements together carry sufficient weight, in terms of their reliability and representativeness, to support this conclusion. In particular, the BCR members have to take into account whether their practical experience is corroborated and not contradicted by publicly available or otherwise accessible, reliable information on the existence or absence of requests within the same sector and/or the application of the law in practice, such as case law and reports by independent oversight bodies."
