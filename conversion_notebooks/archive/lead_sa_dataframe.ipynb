       "## 2.1 Identify the 'main establishment' for controllers\n",
       "\n",
       "In order to establish where the main establishment is, it is firstly necessary to identify the central administration of the data controller in the EU, if any.[^1]  The approach implied in the GDPR is that the central administration in the EU is the place where decisions about the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken and this place has the power to have such decisions implemented.\n",
       "\n",
       "The essence of the lead authority principle in the GDPR is that the supervision of cross-border processing should be led by only one supervisory authority in the EU. In  cases where decisions relating to different cross-border processing activities are taken within the EU central administration, there will be a single lead supervisory authority for the various data processing activities carried out by the multinational company. However, there may be cases where an establishment other than the place of central administration makes autonomous decisions concerning the purposes and means of a specific processing activity. This means that there can be situations where more than one lead authority can be identified, i.e. in cases where a multinational company decides to have separate decision making centres, in different countries, for different processing activities.\n",
       "\n",
       "It is worth recalling, that where a multinational company centralises all the decisions relating to the purposes and means of processing activities in one of its establishments in the EU (and that establishment has the power to implement such decisions), only one lead supervisory authority will be identified for the multinational.\n",
       "\n",
       "In these situations it will be essential for companies to identify precisely where the decisions on purpose and means of processing are taken. Correct identification of the main establishment is in the interests of controllers and processors because it provides clarity in terms of which supervisory authority they have to deal with in respect of their various compliance duties under the GDPR. These may include, where relevant, designating a data protection officer or consulting for a risky processing activity that the controller cannot mitigate by reasonable means. The relevant provisions of the GDPR are intended to make these compliance tasks manageable.   The examples below illustrate this:\n",
       "\n",
       "Example 1:\n",
       "\n",
       "A food retailer has its headquarters (i.e. its 'place of central administration') in Rotterdam, Netherlands. It has establishments in various other EU countries, which are in contact with individuals there. All establishments make use of the same software to process consumers' personal data for marketing purposes. All the decisions about the purposes and means of the processing of consumers' personal data for marketing purposes are taken within its Rotterdam headquarters. This means that the company's lead supervisory authority for this cross border processing activity is the Netherlands supervisory authority.\n",
       "\n",
       "Example 2:\n",
       "\n",
       "A bank has its corporate headquarters in Frankfurt, and all[^2] its banking processing activities are organised from there, but its insurance department is located in Vienna. If the establishment in Vienna has the power to decide on all insurance data processing activity  and to implement these decisions for the whole EU, then as foreseen in Art 4(16) of the GDPR, the Austrian supervisory authority would be the lead authority in respect of the cross border processing of personal data for  insurance purposes, and the German authorities (Hessen supervisory authority) would supervise the processing of personal data for banking purposes, wherever the clients are located.[^3]\n",
       "\n",
       "  \n",
       "[^1]: The GDPR is relevant for the EEA and will apply after its incorporation into the EEA Agreement. The GDPR is currently under scrutiny for incorporation, see http://www.efta.int/eea-lex/32016R0679  \n",
       "[^2]: In the context of processing personal data for banking purposes, we recognise that are many different processing activities involved in this. However, to simplify matters, we address all of them as a single purpose. The same is true of processing done for insurance purposes.  \n",
       "[^3]: It should be recalled also that the GDPR provides for the possibility of local oversight in specific cases. See  Recital (127): \"Each supervisory authority not acting as the lead supervisory authority should be competent to handle local cases where the controller or processor is established in more than one Member State, but the subject matter of the specific processing concerns only processing carried out in a single Member State and involves only data subjects in that single Member State, for example, where the subject matter concerns the processing of employees' personal data in the specific employment context of a Member State.\" This principle means that the supervision of HR data connected to local employment context could fall to several supervisory authorities."
