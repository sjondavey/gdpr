      "8 CONSENT OBTAINED UNDER DIRECTIVE 95/46/EC \n",
      "166. Controllers that currently process data on the basis of consent in compliance with national data protection law are not automatically required to completely refresh all existing consent relations with data subjects in preparation for the GDPR. Consent, which has been obtained, to date continues to be valid in so far as it is in line with the conditions laid down in the GDPR. \n",
      "167. It is important for controllers to review current work processes and records in detail, before 25 May 2018, to be sure existing consents meet the GDPR standard (see Recital 171 of the GDPR[^78]). In practice, the GDPR raises the bar with regard to implementing consent mechanisms and introduces several new requirements that require controllers to alter consent mechanisms, rather than rewriting privacy policies alone.[^79]\n",
      "168. For example, as the GDPR requires that a controller must be able to demonstrate that valid consent was obtained, all presumed consents of which no references are kept will automatically be below the consent standard of the GDPR and will need to be renewed. Likewise as the GDPR requires a \"statement or a clear affirmative action\", all presumed consents that were based on a more implied form of action by the data subject (e.g. a pre-ticked opt-in box) will also not be apt to the GDPR standard of consent. \n",
      "169. Furthermore, to be able to demonstrate that consent was obtained or to allow for more granular indications of the data subject's wishes, operations and IT systems may need revision. Also, mechanisms for data subjects to withdraw their consent easily must be available and information about how to withdraw consent must be provided. If existing procedures for obtaining and managing consent do not meet the GDPR's standards, controllers will need to obtain fresh GDPR compliant consent. \n",
      "170. On the other hand, as not all elements named in Articles 13 and 14 must always be present as a condition for informed consent, the extended information obligations under the GDPR do not necessarily oppose the continuity of consent, which has been granted before the GDPR enters into force (see page 15 above). Under Directive 95/46/EC, there was no requirement to inform data subjects of the basis upon which the processing was being conducted. \n",
      "171. If a controller finds that the consent previously obtained under the old legislation will not meet the standard of GDPR consent, then controllers must undertake action to comply with these standards, for example by refreshing consent in a GDPR-compliant way. Under the GDPR, it is not possible to swap between one lawful basis and another. If a controller is unable to renew consent in a compliant way and is also unable -as a one off situation- to make the transition to GDPR compliance by basing data processing on a different lawful basis while ensuring that continued processing is fair and accounted for, the processing activities must be stopped. In any event, the controller needs to observe the principles of lawful, fair and transparent processing. \n",
      "\n",
      "[^78] Recital 171 GDPR states: \"Directive 95/46/EC should be repealed by this Regulation. Processing already under way on the date of application of this Regulation should be brought into conformity with this Regulation within the period of two years after which this Regulation enters into force. Where processing is based on consent pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC, it is not necessary for the data subject to give his or her consent again if the manner in which the consent has been given is in line with the conditions of this Regulation, so as to allow the controller to continue such processing after the date of application of this Regulation. Commission decisions adopted and authorisations by supervisory authorities based on Directive 95/46/EC remain in force until amended, replaced or repealed.\"\n",
      "[^79] As indicated in the introduction, the GDPR provides further clarification and specification of the requirements for obtaining and demonstrating valid consent. Many of the new requirements build upon Opinion 15/2011 on consent.\n",

If the code covers multiple Member States, it undergoes a review process by the Board and, if found compliant, is forwarded to the Commission for potential Union-wide validity.\n",
      "The Commission is responsible for making codes with general validity widely known while the Board compiles and publishes all approved codes.\n",
      "-- You may choose to follow a code of conduct to help comply with GDPR. A specific body, which must be accredited by the supervisory authority, will monitor your compliance with this code. This body has to prove its independence, expertise, and have mechanisms for assessing compliance, handling complaints, and ensuring no conflicts of interest. The supervisory authority will establish the criteria for accrediting these bodies and can revoke accreditation if the body fails to meet standards or breaches GDPR. This body can take actions against you, including suspension or exclusion from the code if you infringe on its rules, and must inform the authority about such actions. However, public authorities and bodies are not subject to these monitoring requirements.\n",
      "-- You are encouraged to seek data protection certification, seals or marks to demonstrate your compliance with the GDPR. This is particularly suggested for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. Certifications can also be used to show you have appropriate safeguards for transferring personal data to countries or international organisations outside the EU. Certification is voluntary and should be transparent. Holding a certification does not exempt you from your compliance obligations under the GDPR. Certifications are issued by authorised bodies based on approved criteria and are valid for up to three years, with the possibility of renewal if compliance is maintained. If you fail to meet the certification requirements, your certification can be withdrawn. You must provide all necessary information and access to your processing activities for the certification process. A register of all certifications will be made publicly available.\n",
      "-- Certification bodies with data protection expertise can issue and renew certifications after informing the supervisory authority. These bodies must be accredited either by the supervisory authority or the national accreditation body following specific standards and additional requirements.\n",
      "To be accredited, these bodies must prove their independence and expertise, commit to approved certification criteria, have procedures for issuing, reviewing, and withdrawing certifications, handle complaints transparently, and ensure no conflicts of interest. Accreditation is based on criteria approved by the supervisory authority or the Board and lasts up to five years, renewable if the body continues to meet requirements.\n",
      "Certification bodies must explain their reasons for granting or withdrawing certifications to the supervisory authorities. Accreditation criteria and certification requirements must be publicly available, and violations by certification bodies can lead to revocation of their accreditation.\n",
      "The European Commission has the power to define more specific requirements for data protection certification and to adopt technical standards for such mechanisms, aiming to promote and recognize data protection certifications, seals, and marks.\n",
      "-- You can only transfer personal data to a non-EU country or international organisation if it meets GDPR requirements, ensuring protection levels are not reduced. This also applies to any further transfer from that third country or organisation to another.\n",
      "-- You can transfer personal data to a third country or international organisation without specific authorisation if the European Commission has recognised that location as providing an adequate level of protection. The Commission evaluates adequacy based on the rule of law, human rights respect, relevant legislation, data protection measures, the existence of supervisory authorities, and international commitments related to data protection.\n",
      "After assessing the protection level, the Commission may declare that a third country, specific territory, or organisation ensures adequate protection, subject to a review at least every four years. This decision will outline its application scope and identify any supervisory authority involved.\n",
      "The Commission continuously monitors changes that could impact the validity of its adequacy decisions, and if it finds a country or organisation no longer provides adequate protection, it can repeal, amend, or suspend the decision without retroactive effect. In urgent cases, immediate actions can be taken.\n",
      "The Commission will try to remedy any situations leading to an inadequacy decision by consulting with the affected country or organisation. Despite such decisions, personal data may still be transferred under specific conditions.\n",
      "A list of countries, territories, and organisations deemed to provide or not provide adequate protection will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and on the Commission's website. Previous decisions made under Directive 95/46/EC remain effective until they are updated or repealed.\n",
      "-- You can transfer personal data to countries outside the EU or international organisations only if you provide appropriate safeguards and ensure that individuals have enforceable rights and effective legal remedies.\n",
      "The safeguards can be provided without needing specific approval from a supervisory authority through:\n",
      "- Legally binding instruments between public bodies;\n",
      "- Binding corporate rules;\n",
      "- Standard data protection clauses by the Commission;\n",
      "- Standard data protection clauses adopted by a supervisory authority and approved by the Commission;\n",
      "- An approved code of conduct with binding commitments in the third country;\n",
      "- An approved certification mechanism with binding commitments in the third country.\n",
      "If authorisation from a supervisory authority is needed, safeguards may include:\n",
      "- Contractual clauses between you and the data receiver outside the EU;\n",
      "- Administrative arrangements between public bodies with enforceable rights for individuals.\n",
      "The supervisory authority must use the consistency mechanism for cases requiring its authorisation. Existing authorisations based on old rules remain valid until changed or repealed by a supervisory authority. Commission decisions under the old directive stay in effect until updated or repealed by a new Commission Decision.\n",
      "-- If you, as a business, plan to use binding corporate rules (BCRs) for international data transfers within your group of companies, these rules must first be approved by the relevant data protection authority. BCRs need to be legally enforceable across your group and give individuals rights concerning their personal data processing. The BCRs should detail your group’s structure, data transfer specifics, including types of data and processing purposes, affirm their binding nature, adhere to core data protection principles, specify individual rights and means for their exercise, including compensation mechanisms for rule breaches, and outline your liability for any breach by group members outside the EU. \n",
      "Moreover, BCRs should clarify how information about them is communicated to individuals, assign responsibility for compliance monitoring (potentially to a Data Protection Officer), describe internal complaint and compliance verification mechanisms, including data protection audits, and detail the process for updating BCRs and liaising with supervisory authorities about changes or compliance issues. They must also address cooperation with supervisory authorities, report on local legal obligations conflicting with BCRs' guarantees, and ensure relevant personnel receive data protection training.\n",
      "The European Commission may issue further guidelines on the format and procedures for managing BCR-related information exchanges between your business, other entities, and supervisory authorities.\n",
      "-- If a court, tribunal, or administrative authority outside the EU asks you to transfer or disclose personal information, you can only comply if there's an international agreement (like a mutual legal assistance treaty) between the EU or its Member State and that non-EU country. This must be done without ignoring other legal grounds for transferring personal data outlined in GDPR.\n",
      "-- In the absence of specific international data transfer agreements or safeguards:\n",
      "- You may transfer personal data abroad if the individual has explicitly agreed, aware of potential risks.\n",
      "- Transfers are allowed if necessary for contract performance with or in the interest of the individual, or for important public interest reasons.\n",
      "- Transfers can occur for establishing, exercising, or defending legal claims, protecting vital interests of individuals unable to consent, or from registers open to public consultation under certain conditions.\n",
      "- If none of these conditions apply, occasional transfers for compelling legitimate interests may be possible, provided you've assessed the situation, implemented suitable safeguards, informed the supervisory authority, and notified the individual.\n",
      "- Transfers from public registers cannot involve all personal data and must be to those with a legitimate interest.\n",
      "- Certain derogations do not apply to public authorities exercising official functions.\n",
      "- The applicable public interest must be recognised by law.\n",
      "- Member States can restrict data transfers for public interest reasons, notifying the Commission of such provisions.\n",
      "- Document your assessment and safeguards as per Article 30's record-keeping requirements.\n"
