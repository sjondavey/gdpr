BCRs need to be legally enforceable across your group and give individuals rights concerning their personal data processing. The BCRs should detail your group’s structure, data transfer specifics, including types of data and processing purposes, affirm their binding nature, adhere to core data protection principles, specify individual rights and means for their exercise, including compensation mechanisms for rule breaches, and outline your liability for any breach by group members outside the EU. \n",
      "Moreover, BCRs should clarify how information about them is communicated to individuals, assign responsibility for compliance monitoring (potentially to a Data Protection Officer), describe internal complaint and compliance verification mechanisms, including data protection audits, and detail the process for updating BCRs and liaising with supervisory authorities about changes or compliance issues. They must also address cooperation with supervisory authorities, report on local legal obligations conflicting with BCRs' guarantees, and ensure relevant personnel receive data protection training.\n",
