      "Accountability is an important area and an explicit requirement under the GDPR.[^48]   \n",
      "As a key accountability tool, a DPIA enables the controller to assess the risks involved in automated decision-making, including profiling. It is a way of showing that suitable measures have been put in place to address those risks and demonstrate compliance with the GDPR.  \n",
      "Article 35(3) (a) highlights the need for the controller to carry out a DPIA in the case of:  \n",
      "\"a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons which is based on automated processing, including profiling, and on which decisions are based that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or similarly significantly affect the natural person;\"  \n",
      "Article 35(3)(a) refers to evaluations including profiling and decisions that are 'based' on automated processing, rather than  'solely' automated processing. We take this to mean that Article 35(3) (a) will apply in the case of decision-making including profiling with legal or similarly significant effects that is not wholly automated, as well as solely automated decision-making defined in Article 22(1).   \n",
      "If the controller envisages a 'model' where it takes solely automated decisions having a high impact on individuals based on profiles made about them and it cannot rely on the individual's consent, on a contract with the individual or on a law authorising this, the controller should not proceed.   \n",
      "The controller can still envisage a 'model' of decision-making based on profiling, by significantly increasing the level of human intervention so that the model is no longer a fully automated decision making process, although the processing could still present risks to individuals' fundamental rights and freedoms. If so the controller must ensure that they can address these risks and meet the requirements described in Chapter III of these Guidelines.   \n",
      "A DPIA can also be a useful way for the controller to identify what measures they will introduce to address the data protection risks involved with the processing. Such measures[^49] could include: \n",
      "- informing the data subject about the existence of and the logic involved in the automated decision-making process; \n",
      "- explaining  the significance and envisaged consequences of the processing for the data subject; \n",
      "- providing the data subject with the means to oppose the decision; and \n",
      "- allowing the data subject to express their point of view.  \n",
      "Other profiling activities may warrant a DPIA, depending upon the specifics of the case. Controllers may wish to consult the WP29 guidelines on DPIAs[^50] for further information and to help determine the need to carry out a DPIA.  \n",
      "An additional accountability requirement is the designation of a DPO, where the profiling and/or the automated decision-making is a core activity of the controller and requires regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale (Article 37(1)(b).[^51]\n",

When a decision is necessary for a contract or based on consent, you must ensure there are measures in place allowing the individual to seek human intervention, express their point of view, and contest the decision. Decisions should not be based on special categories of personal data unless it's necessary for rights or health purposes and appropriate safeguards are established to protect the individual's rights and interests.\n"
