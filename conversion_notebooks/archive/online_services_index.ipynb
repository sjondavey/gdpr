      "57. The EDPB acknowledges that personalisation of content may (but does not always) constitute an intrinsic and expected element of certain online services, and therefore may be regarded as necessary for the performance of the contract with the service user in some cases. Whether such processing can be regarded as an intrinsic aspect of an online service, will depend on the nature of the service provided, the expectations of the average data subject in light not only of the terms of service but also the way the service is promoted to users, and whether the service can be provided without personalisation. Where personalisation of content is not objectively necessary for the purpose of the underlying contract, for example where personalised content delivery is intended to increase user engagement with a service but is not an integral part of using the service, data controllers should consider an alternative lawful basis where applicable.  \n",
      "Example 7   \n",
      "An online hotel search engine monitors past bookings of users in order to create a profile of their typical expenditure. This profile is subsequently used to recommend particular hotels to the user when returning search results. In this case, profiling of user's past behaviour and financial data would not be objectively necessary for the performance of a contract, i.e. the provision of hospitality services based on particular search criteria provided by the user. Therefore, Article 6(1)(b) would not be applicable to this processing activity.   \n",
      "Example 8   \n",

The marketplace wishes to display personalised product suggestions based on which listings the potential buyers have previously viewed on the platform in order to increase interactivity.

      "-- Personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently, collected for specific and legitimate purposes, and not used incompatibly with those purposes. It should be adequate, relevant, and limited to necessary data, accurate and updated as needed, with inaccurate data erased or rectified promptly. Data should only be kept as long as necessary for its initial purposes, though it can be stored longer for public interest, research, or statistical purposes if safeguard measures are in place. It must be secured against unauthorised access, loss, or damage. The controller is responsible for ensuring and demonstrating compliance with these principles.\n",
      "-- The Commission and supervisory authorities are tasked with developing mechanisms to support international cooperation on data protection enforcement. They will offer mutual assistance in data protection law enforcement, including notification and information exchanges, with necessary protections for personal data. Additionally, there will be engagement with stakeholders to advance global cooperation in enforcing data protection laws and promoting the sharing and documenting of data protection practices and legislation, including dealing with jurisdictional conflicts with non-EU countries.\n",
      "-- Each Member State must establish one or more independent authorities responsible for ensuring GDPR compliance to protect individual rights regarding personal data and to support the free movement of personal data within the EU. These authorities must work together to apply GDPR consistently across the EU. If a Member State has multiple authorities, it must select one to represent them in the Board and outline how to comply with consistency rules.\n",
      "-- Supervisory authorities must act independently when carrying out their tasks and exercising their rights under this regulation. They must not be influenced externally and cannot take instructions from anyone. They are not allowed to engage in any activity that conflicts with their duties during their term. Each supervisory authority must be provided with adequate resources, staff, and budget by their Member State to perform effectively, with safeguards in place to maintain their independence.\n",
      "-- Member States must ensure each supervisory authority member is appointed through a transparent process by their parliament, government, head of State, or an independent appointing body as per their law. Appointees must possess necessary qualifications, experience, and skills in data protection. A member's term ends upon reaching their term limit, resignation, or mandatory retirement according to national law, and they can only be dismissed in cases of serious misconduct or inability to perform their duties.\n",
      "-- Member States must legislate to:\n",
      "- Establish each supervisory authority,\n",
      "- Define qualifications and eligibility for supervisory authority membership,\n",
      "- Set rules and procedures for appointing members,\n",
      "- Ensure member terms last at least four years, with possible exceptions for the first appointment to maintain independence via staggered terms,\n",
      "- Determine if members can be reappointed and for how many terms,\n",
      "- Establish conditions and prohibitions for members and staff during and after their tenure, including employment termination rules.\n",
      "Members and staff of supervisory authorities must keep professional secrets during and after their terms, particularly concerning confidential information acquired during their duties, including reports of GDPR infringements.\n",
      "-- Supervisory authorities are responsible for overseeing GDPR compliance within their own Member State. For processing by public authorities or private entities under specific conditions, the supervisory authority of that Member State is competent. Supervisory authorities do not oversee court operations when courts are acting in their judicial capacity.\n",
      "-- For cross-border processing, the supervisory authority where your main or sole establishment is located will act as your lead supervisory authority. However, local supervisory authorities can address complaints or possible breaches that are specific to their Member State or significantly impact individuals within their Member State. When such a case arises, the local supervisory authority must promptly inform your lead supervisory authority. The lead authority then has three weeks to decide if it will handle the case via Article 60's procedure. If the lead authority opts to take the case, it will consider any decision drafts from the informing local authority. Conversely, if the lead authority decides not to take the case, the informing local authority will proceed according to Articles 61 and 62. Throughout this process, for cross-border processing issues, the lead supervisory authority will be your primary point of contact.\n",
      "-- Supervisory authorities are responsible for monitoring and enforcing GDPR within their territories, which includes promoting understanding of GDPR to the public, advising governmental and legislative bodies on data protection matters, and increasing awareness among you about your obligations under GDPR. They also provide information to individuals about their rights, handle and investigate complaints related to GDPR, cooperate and share information with other supervisory authorities to ensure consistent application of GDPR, and monitor developments that affect personal data protection.\n",
      "They are also tasked with adopting standard contractual clauses, maintaining a list for data protection impact assessment (DPIA)s, advising on processing operations that require consultation, encouraging codes of conduct and certification mechanisms, conducting periodic reviews of certifications, drafting and publishing accreditation criteria, conducting accreditations, authorising contractual clauses and provisions, approving binding corporate rules, contributing to the activities of the Board, keeping records of GDPR infringements and taken measures, and performing other related tasks.\n",
      "Supervisory authorities must facilitate easy submission of complaints, including through electronic means. Their services to individuals and data protection officers are generally free, but they can charge a fee or refuse requests deemed manifestly unfounded or excessive, provided they prove the basis for such decision.\n",
      "-- Supervisory authorities have the right to request information from you, carry out data protection audits, review certifications related to data protection, notify you of GDPR infringements, access personal data and premises for investigation, and enforce corrective measures such as issuing warnings, reprimands, compliance orders, communicate data breaches to individuals, limit or ban processing activities, rectify or erase personal data, withdraw certifications, impose administrative fines, and suspend data flows to third countries or international organisations. They can also provide advice, issue opinions on data protection matters, authorise specific types of data processing, accredit certification bodies, issue certifications, and approve codes of conduct and binding corporate rules. These powers are to be exercised with due process and judicial remedy options available. Supervisory authorities can also bring GDPR infringements to judicial attention and engage in legal proceedings to enforce the regulation. Member States may grant additional powers to supervisory authorities, provided these do not affect the operation of GDPR enforcement mechanisms.\n",
      "-- Supervisory authorities must create an annual report detailing their activities. This can include information on reported violations and actions taken. These reports must be sent to the national parliament, government, and specific authorities set by national laws. They must also be available to the public, the Commission, and the Board.\n"
