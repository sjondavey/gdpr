       "\"The 'supervisory authority concerned' is a supervisory authority involved in personal data processing due to:\\n\\n(a) The establishment of the controller or processor in its Member State.\\n(b) Significant impact on individuals residing in its Member State.\\n(c) Complaints received by that authority.\\n\\nThis ensures other authorities can influence decisions despite the 'lead authority' model. Factors like residency, not citizenship, suffice for involvement. \\n\\nWhen a lead supervisory authority opts not to handle a case, the concerned one that informed the lead should take over, following the procedures in Article 61 (Mutual assistance) and Article 62 (Joint operations of supervisory authorities). For example, if a French company launches a product affecting only Portuguese individuals, both authorities may agree that the Portuguese authority should lead the matter.\\n\\nSupervisory authorities may request controllers provide clarifications on corporate arrangements. These authorities should collaborate to ensure satisfactory investigations and outcomes for individuals. Co-operation and mutual decision-making are encouraged, with the consistency mechanism as a last resort. Consensus between supervisory authorities is critical for effective GDPR cooperation and consistency.\""
