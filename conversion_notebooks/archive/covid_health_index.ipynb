      "7 INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PURPOSES \n",
      "58. Within the context of research and specifically in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, there will probably be a need for international cooperation that may also imply international transfers of health data for the purpose of scientific research outside of the EEA. \n",
      "59. When personal data is transferred to a non-EEA country or international organisation, in addition to complying with the rules set out in GDPR,[^19] especially its Articles 5 (data protection principles), Article 6 (lawfulness) and Article 9 (special categories of data),[^20] the data exporter shall also comply with Chapter V (data transfers).[^21] \n",
      "60. In addition to the regular transparency requirement as mentioned on page 7 of the present guidelines,  a duty rests on the data exporter to inform data subjects that it intends to transfer personal data to a third country or international organisation. This includes information about the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by the European Commission, or whether the transfer is based on a suitable safeguard from Article 46 or on a derogation of Article 49 (1). This duty exists irrespective of whether the personal data was obtained directly from the data subject or not. \n",
      "61. In general, when considering how to address such conditions for transfers of personal data to third countries or international organisations, data exporters should assess the risks to the rights and the freedoms of data subjects of each transfer[^22] and favour solutions that guarantee data subjects the continuous protection of their fundamental rights and safeguards as regards the processing of their data, even after it has been transferred. This will be the case for transfers to countries having an adequate level of protection,[^23] or in case of use of one of the appropriate safeguards included in Article 46 GDPR,[^24] ensuring that enforceable rights and effective legal remedies are available for data subjects. \n",
      "62. In the absence of an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 (3) GDPR or appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46 GDPR, Article 49 GDPR envisages certain specific situations under which transfers of personal data can take place as an exception. The derogations enshrined in Article 49 GDPR are thus exemptions from the general rule and, therefore, must be interpreted restrictively, and on a case-by-case basis.[^25] Applied to the current COVID-19 crisis, those addressed in Article 49 (1) (d) (\"transfer necessary for important reasons of public interest\") and (a) (\"explicit consent\") may apply.  \n",
      "63. The COVID-19 pandemic causes an exceptional sanitary crisis of an unprecedented nature and scale. In this context, the EDPB considers that the fight against COVID-19 has been recognised by the EU and most of its Member States as an important public interest,[^26] which may require urgent action in the field of scientific research (for example to identify treatments and/or develop vaccines), and may also involve transfers to third countries or international organisations.[^27] \n",
      "64. Not only public authorities, but also private entities playing a role in pursuing such public interest (for example, a university's research institute cooperating on the development of a vaccine in the context of an international partnership) could, under the current pandemic context, rely upon the derogation mentioned above.  \n",
      "65. In addition, in certain situations, in particular where transfers are performed by private entities for the purpose of medical research aiming at fighting the COVID-19 pandemic,[^28] such transfers of personal data could alternatively take place on the basis of the explicit consent of the data subjects. [^29]\n",
      "66. Public authorities and private entities may, under the current pandemic context, when it is not possible to rely on an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 (3) or on appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46, rely upon the applicable derogations mentioned above, mainly as a temporary measure due to the urgency of the medical situation globally. \n",
      "67. Indeed, if the nature of the COVID-19 crisis may justify the use of the applicable derogations for initial transfers carried out for the purpose of research in this context, repetitive transfers of data to third countries part of a long lasting research project in this regard would need to be framed with appropriate safeguards in accordance with Article 46 GDPR.[^30]\n",
      "68. Finally, it has to be noted that any such transfers will need to take into consideration on a case-by-case basis the respective roles (controller, processor, joint controller) and related obligations of the actors involved (sponsor, investigator) in order to identify the appropriate measures for framing the transfer. \n",

On this basis, Union action supports national policies to improve public health, including in combatting against major health scourges and serious cross-border threats to health, e.g. by promoting research into their causes, transmission and prevention. Similarly, Recitals 46 and 112 of the GDPR refer to processing carried out in the context of the fight against epidemics as an example of processing serving important grounds of public interest. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the EU has adopted a series of measures in a broad range of areas (e.g. funding of healthcare systems, support to cross-border patients and deployment of medical staff, financial assistance to the most deprived, transport, medical devices etc.) premised on the understanding that the EU is facing a major public health emergency requiring an urgent response.\n",

      "8 SUMMARY \n",
      "69. The key findings of these guidelines are: \n",
      "    1. The GDPR provides special rules for the processing of health data for the purpose of scientific research that are also applicable in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n",
      "    2. The national legislator of each Member State may enact specific laws pursuant to Article (9) (2) (i) and (j) GDPR to enable the processing of health data for scientific research purposes. The processing of health data for the purpose of scientific research must also be covered by one of the legal bases in Article 6 (1) GDPR. Therefore, the conditions and the extent for such processing varies depending on the enacted laws of the particular member state. \n",
      "    3. All enacted laws based on Article (9) (2) (i) and (j) GDPR must be interpreted in the light of the principles pursuant to Article 5 GDPR and in consideration of the jurisprudence of the ECJ. In particular, derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of data provided in Article 9 (2) (j) and Article 89 (2) GDPR must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary. \n",
      "    4. Considering the processing risks in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak, high emphasise must be put on compliance with Article 5 (1) (f), Article 32 (1) and Article 89 (1) GDPR. There must be an assessment if a DPIA pursuant to Article 35 GDPR has to be carried out. \n",
      "    5. Storage periods (timelines) shall be set and must be proportionate. In order to define such storage periods, criteria such as the length and the purpose of the research should be taken into account. National provisions may stipulate rules concerning the storage period as well and must therefore be considered. \n",
      "    6. In principle, situations as the current COVID-19 outbreak do not suspend or restrict the possibility of data subjects to exercise their rights pursuant to Article 12 to 22 GDPR. However, Article 89 (2) GDPR allows the national legislator to restrict (some) of the data subject's rights as set in Chapter 3 of the GDPR. Because of this, the restrictions of the rights of data subjects may vary depending on the enacted laws of the particular Member State. \n",
      "    7. With respect to international transfers, in the absence of an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 (3) GDPR or appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46 GDPR, public authorities and private entities may rely upon the applicable derogations pursuant to Article 49 GDPR. However, the derogations of Article 49 GDPR do have exceptional character only. \n",
