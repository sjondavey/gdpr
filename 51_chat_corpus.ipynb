The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her.\\n\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if the decision:\\n\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller;\\n\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) is authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests; or\\n\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) is based on the data subject's explicit consent.\\n\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. In the cases referred to in points (a) and (c) of paragraph 2, the data controller shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and to contest the decision.\\n\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Decisions referred to in paragraph 2 shall not be based on special categories of personal data referred to in Article 9(1), unless point (a) or (g) of Article 9(2) applies and suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests are in place.\\n\\n  \\nSection IV.D from Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making and Profiling for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679: \\n# IV Specific provisions on solely automated decision- making as defined in Article 22\\n\\n## IV.D Special categories of personal data - Article 22(4)\\n\\nAutomated decision-making (described in Article 22(1)) that involves special categories of personal data is only allowed under the following cumulative conditions (Article 22(4)):\\n\\n- there is an applicable Article 22(2) exemption; and\\n\\n- point (a) or (g) of Article 9(2) applies.\\n\\n9(2) (a) - the explicit consent of the data subject; or\\n\\n9(2) (g) - processing necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of Union or Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and interests of the data subject.\\n\\nIn both of the above cases, the controller must put in place suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests.  \\nSection IV.C from Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making and Profiling for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679: \\n# IV Specific provisions on solely automated decision- making as defined in Article 22\\n\\n## IV.C Exceptions from the prohibition\\n\\nArticle 22(1) sets out a general prohibition on solely automated individual decision-making with legal or similarly significant effects, as described above.\\n\\nThis means that the controller should not undertake the processing described in Article 22(1) unless one of the following Article 22(2) exceptions applies - where the decision is:\\n\\n(a) necessary for the performance of or entering into a contract;\\n\\n(b) authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests; or\\n\\n(c) based on the data subject's explicit consent.\\n\\nWhere the decision-making involves special categories of data defined in Article 9(1) the controller must also ensure that they can meet the requirements of Article 22(4).\\n\\n### IV.C.1 Performance of a contract\\n\\nControllers may wish to use solely automated decision-making processes for contractual purposes because they believe it is the most appropriate way to achieve the objective. Routine human involvement can sometimes be impractical or impossible due to the sheer quantity of data being processed.\\n\\nThe controller must be able to show that this type of processing is necessary, taking into account whether a less privacy-intrusive method could be adopted.[^35]  If other effective and less intrusive means to achieve the same goal exist, then it would not be 'necessary'.\\n\\nAutomated decision-making described in Article 22(1) may also be necessary for pre-contractual processing.\\n\\nExample\\n\\nA business advertises an open position. As working for the business in question is popular, the business receives tens of thousands of applications. Due to the exceptionally high volume of applications, the business may find that it is not practically possible to identify fitting candidates without first using fully automated means to sift out irrelevant applications. In this case, automated decision-making may be necessary in order to make a short list of possible candidates, with the intention of entering into a contract with a data subject.\\n\\nChapter III (Section B) provides more information on contracts as a lawful basis for processing.\\n\\n### IV.C.2 Authorised by Union or Member State law\\n\\nAutomated decision-making including profiling could potentially take place under 22(2)(b) if Union or Member State law authorised its use. The relevant law must also lay down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests.\\n\\nRecital 71 says that this could include the use of automated decision-making defined in Article 22(1) for monitoring and preventing fraud and tax-evasion, or to ensure the security and reliability of a service provided by the controller.\\n\\n### IV.C.3 Explicit consent\\n\\nArticle 22 requires explicit consent. Processing that falls within the definition of Article 22(1) poses significant data protection risks and a high level of individual control over personal data is therefore deemed appropriate.\\n\\n'Explicit consent' is not defined in the GDPR. The WP29 guidelines on consent[^36] provide guidance on how this should be interpreted. Chapter III (Section B) provides more information on consent generally.\\n\\n  \\n[^35]: Buttarelli, Giovanni.

       "\"3 PART 3 - APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE 6(1)(B) IN SPECIFIC SITUATIONS \\n\\n3.4 Processing for personalisation of content[^34]\\n57. The EDPB acknowledges that personalisation of content may (but does not always) constitute an intrinsic and expected element of certain online services, and therefore may be regarded as necessary for the performance of the contract with the service user in some cases. Whether such processing can be regarded as an intrinsic aspect of an online service, will depend on the nature of the service provided, the expectations of the average data subject in light not only of the terms of service but also the way the service is promoted to users, and whether the service can be provided without personalisation. Where personalisation of content is not objectively necessary for the purpose of the underlying contract, for example where personalised content delivery is intended to increase user engagement with a service but is not an integral part of using the service, data controllers should consider an alternative lawful basis where applicable.  \\nExample 7   \\nAn online hotel search engine monitors past bookings of users in order to create a profile of their typical expenditure. This profile is subsequently used to recommend particular hotels to the user when returning search results. In this case, profiling of user's past behaviour and financial data would not be objectively necessary for the performance of a contract, i.e. the provision of hospitality services based on particular search criteria provided by the user. Therefore, Article 6(1)(b) would not be applicable to this processing activity.   \\nExample 8   \\nAn online marketplace allows potential buyers to browse for and purchase products. The marketplace wishes to display personalised product suggestions based on which listings the potential buyers have previously viewed on the platform in order to increase interactivity. This personalisation it is not objectively necessary to provide the marketplace service. Thus, such processing of personal data cannot rely on Article 6(1)(b) as a legal basis. \\n\\n[^34] Online services may also need to take into account Directive (EU) 2019/770 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services (OJ L 136, 22.05.2019, p. 1), which will apply as from 1 January 2022.\""

       "'I Restrictions on data subject rights \\n68. Article 23 provides for Member States (or the EU) to legislate for further restrictions on the scope of the data subject rights in relation to transparency and the substantive data subject rights[^55] where such measures respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and are necessary and proportionate to safeguard one or more of the ten objectives set out in Article 23.1(a) to (j). Where such national measures lessen either the specific data subject rights or the general transparency obligations, which would otherwise apply to data controllers under the GDPR, the data controller should be able to demonstrate how the national provision applies to them. As set out in Article 23.2(h), the legislative measure must contain a provision as to the right of the data subject to be informed about a restriction on their rights, unless so informing them may be prejudicial to the purpose of the restriction. Consistent with this, and in line with principle of fairness, the data controller should also inform data subjects that they are relying on (or will rely on, in the event of a particular data subject right being exercised) such a national legislative restriction to the exercise of data subject rights, or to the transparency obligation, unless doing so would be prejudicial to the purpose of the legislative restriction. As such, transparency requires data controllers to provide adequate upfront information to data subjects about their rights and any particular caveats to those rights which the controller may seek to rely on, so that the data subject is not taken by surprise at a purported restriction of a particular right when they later attempt to exercise it against the controller. In relation to pseudonymisation and data minimisation, and insofar as data controllers may purport to rely on Article 11 of the GDPR, WP29 has previously confirmed in Opinion 3/ 2017[^56] that Article 11 of the GDPR should be interpreted as a way of enforcing genuine data minimisation without hindering the exercise of data subject rights, and that the exercise of data subject rights must be made possible with the help of additional information provided by the data subject.   \\n69. Additionally, Article 85 requires Member States, by law, to reconcile data protection with the right to freedom of expression and information. This requires, amongst other things, that Member States provide for appropriate exemptions or derogations from certain provisions of the GDPR (including from the transparency requirements under Articles 12 - 14) for processing carried out for journalistic, academic, artistic or literary expression purposes, if they are necessary to reconcile the two rights. \\n\\n[^55] As set out in Articles 12 to 22 and 34, and in Article 5 insofar as its provisions correspond to the rights and obligations provided for in Articles 12 to 22.\\n[^56] Opinion 03/2017 on Processing personal data in the context of Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) - see paragraph 4.2'"
