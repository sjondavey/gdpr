        "content": "<a id=\"dp1\"></a>What do we mean by monitoring workers?</span></h3>\n<p>Workers largely recognise that employers carry out checks on the quality and quantity of their work. Employers may also monitor workers to protect health and safety, or to meet regulatory obligations (eg requirements in the financial services industry). Monitoring can also form part of the security measures an organisation has in place to protect personal information. Increasingly, employers are using data analytics to infer worker performance and wellbeing.</p>\n<p>We use the term \u2018monitoring workers\u2019 to mean any form of monitoring of people who carry out work on your behalf. This can include monitoring workers on particular work premises or elsewhere, and can include monitoring during or outside work hours. To comply with data protection law, you <strong>must</strong> do this monitoring in a way that is lawful and fair to workers.</p>\n<p>This guidance is not relevant to people recording information in a personal or household context, unless there is professional or commercial activity. For example, you run a business from home. This guidance also covers you if you employ a visiting worker to your household, such as a nanny or gardener, and monitor their activity routinely, or on an ongoing basis. It is also important to note that homeworking does not constitute personal or household processing, and so is also covered by this guidance.</p>\n<p>Excessive monitoring can have an adverse impact on the data protection rights and freedoms of workers. Excessive monitoring is likely to intrude into workers\u2019 private lives and undermine their privacy and mental wellbeing. It is not always easy to distinguish between workplace and private information, especially when workers are based at home. Some workers may also use personal devices for work. Monitoring communications between a worker and their union representative or capturing a worker\u2019s personal correspondence both give rise to significant concerns. (See the sections <a href=\"#dp5\" data-anchor=\"#dp5\">What if our monitoring involves special category data?</a> and <a rel=\"noopener\" data-udi=\"umb://document/4c3b34bf0db04c2192d3d01e2f32d300\" href=\"/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/employment/monitoring-workers/specific-data-protection-considerations-for-different-ways-or-methods-of-monitoring-workers/#specific4\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Specific data protection considerations for different ways or methods of monitoring workers\" data-anchor=\"#specific4\" class=\"link-external\">Can we monitor emails and messages?<span class=\"invisible\"></span></a>.)</p>\n<p>As an employer, there may be occasions when you to need to consider sharing personal information you have obtained from monitoring your workers with a law enforcement authority. For example, you may discover suspected criminal activity by a worker, such as fraud or theft. This guidance does not apply to processing carried out for the purposes of law enforcement. Law enforcement authorities are subject to the separate law enforcement regime under Part 3 of the DPA 2018.</p>\n<p>This guidance covers systematic monitoring, where an employer monitors all workers or groups of workers as a matter of course. For example, if you use software to monitor productivity. It also applies to occasional monitoring, where an employer introduces monitoring as a short-term response to a specific need. This includes installing a camera to detect suspected theft, or a software package created to monitor workers systematically, but where monitoring functions are not always active, for example taking random screenshots.</p>\n<p>Monitoring technologies and purposes may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>camera surveillance including wearable cameras for the purpose of health and safety;</li>\n<li>webcams and screenshots;</li>\n<li>technologies for monitoring timekeeping or access control;</li>\n<li>keystroke monitoring to track, capture and log keyboard activity;</li>\n<li>productivity tools which log how workers spend their time;</li>\n<li>tracking internet activity and keystrokes;</li>\n<li>body worn devices to track the locations of workers; and</li>\n<li>hidden audio recording.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>The technologies that employers use to monitor their workers have changed rapidly over time and will undoubtedly continue to evolve in sophistication. However, you <strong>must</strong> follow the data protection principles regardless of technological developments.</span></p>\n<div class=\"greenBlock\">\n<p><strong>Further reading</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We have <a data-udi=\"umb://document/886b54e9949f48fc954d5559e556eea3\" href=\"/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/data-sharing/sharing-personal-data-with-law-enforcement-authorities/\" title=\"Sharing personal data with law enforcement authorities\">produced separate guidance to help you if you need to share personal information with a law enforcement authority</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3>"

        "content": "<a id=\"dp2\"></a>Can we monitor workers?</h3>\n<p>Data protection law does not prevent you from monitoring workers, but you <strong>must </strong>do so in a way which is compliant with data protection requirements. Article 8 of the Human Rights Act 1998 concerns the right to respect for a private and family life. This is increasingly important due to the rise of homeworking. Workers\u2019 expectation of privacy are likely to be significantly greater at home than in the workplace and the risks of capturing information about your workers\u2019 family and private lives (if you monitor them when they are working from home) are higher.</p>\n<p>You can monitor workers if you do it in a way which is consistent with data protection law.</p>\n<p>When deciding whether to monitor workers carefully balance your business interests as an employer and workers\u2019 rights and freedoms under data protection law.</p>\n<p>If you carry out monitoring in a way which is unfair, this will impact on their rights and freedoms under data protection law. It will also negatively affect the trust between you and your workers, as well as potentially affecting their mental wellbeing. Just because a form of monitoring is available, does not mean it is the best way to achieve your aims. You <strong>must</strong> be clear about your purpose and select the least intrusive means to achieve it.</p>\n<div class=\"example\"><span class=\"button-circle\"><span class=\"icon-lightbulb-o\"></span></span>\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n<p>After an employer discovers that a small number of remote workers started later than they recorded on their timesheets, it rolls out device monitoring. This allows senior management to access automatic webcam images and check if workers are at work.</p>\n<p>This is likely to infringe data protection law because it is disproportionate, and there are less intrusive ways to check start times.</p>\n<p>The employer can achieve the same purpose by checking the times workers log onto the computer system, and then give workers the opportunity to explain any discrepancies.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>"

        "content": "<a id=\"dp3\"></a>How do we lawfully monitor workers?</h3>\n<p>To lawfully collect and process information from monitoring workers, you <strong>must </strong>identify a lawful basis. There are six to choose from and you <strong>must</strong> identify at least one that is appropriate for the type of processing you intend to do.</p>\n<p>Monitoring workers often includes capturing sensitive information. This is called \u2018special category data\u2019 in the UK GDPR. Because of its sensitivity, special category data requires extra protection. If the nature of your monitoring means that you will collect special category data, or are likely to, you <strong>must</strong> identify a special category processing condition, as well as a lawful basis. (See the sections on <a href=\"#dp4\" data-anchor=\"#dp4\">lawful basis</a> and <a href=\"#dp5\" data-anchor=\"#dp5\">special category data</a>.)</p>\n<p>You <strong>must </strong>also ensure any monitoring is lawful in the general sense. If you are considering monitoring workers, you <strong>should </strong>consider all the legal implications of any other relevant laws.</p>\n<div class=\"example\"><span class=\"button-circle\"><span class=\"icon-lightbulb-o\"></span></span>\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n<p>A bank monitors all transactions made by every worker to prevent and detect fraud. This does not involve processing special category data. The bank needs to identify a lawful basis, but not a condition for processing.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"example\"><span class=\"button-circle\"><span class=\"icon-lightbulb-o\"></span></span>\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n<p>A bank wishes to monitor all email traffic to address the risk of fraud and protect commercially sensitive information. As well as a lawful basis, the bank should identify a special category condition. This is because monitoring all email traffic could detect special category data, such as emails sent to union representatives or to occupational health personnel.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>"

        "content": "<a id=\"dp4\"></a>How do we identify a lawful basis?</h3>\n<p>How you decide which lawful basis applies depends on your specific purpose and the context of the monitoring. You<strong> must </strong>think about why you want to monitor workers. You <strong>must</strong> identify which lawful basis best fits the circumstances. We have listed the available lawful bases below, along with some guidance to help you identify the right basis for your circumstances. You can also use our <a rel=\"noopener\" data-udi=\"umb://document/88de409a5d714bbd8855b87bd8890b50\" href=\"/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/lawful-basis-interactive-guidance-tool/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Lawful basis interactive guidance tool\" class=\"link-external\">interactive guidance tool<span class=\"invisible\"></span></a> to help you. Carrying out a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) may also help you to identify the most appropriate basis.</p>\n<p>You <strong>must not</strong> adopt a one-size-fits-all approach. No one basis is always better, safer or more important than the others. However, some are likely to be more appropriate than others for employers. We highlight some of these below.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, more than one basis might apply. You <strong>should</strong> identify all those that apply, and document them from the start. Try to get it right first time, as you <strong>should not</strong> change it later without good reason.</p>\n<p>The six lawful bases are:</p>\n<h4>Consent</h4>\n<p>The worker gives consent for you to process their personal data for a specific purpose.</p>\n<p>A person <strong>must</strong> freely give their consent for it to be valid. This means that consent is not usually appropriate in the employment context, due to the imbalance of power between you and your workers. Workers are likely to feel that they have no choice but to give you consent.</p>\n<p>Consent <strong>must</strong> be unambiguous and include an affirmative action. You <strong>must</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>give workers the option to withdraw their consent without detriment;</li>\n<li>make this as easy as when they first provided it; and</li>\n<li>keep records of when and how you gained consent, and what exactly workers consented to.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Consent is only appropriate if circumstances mean workers have a genuine choice and control over the monitoring.</p>\n<h4>Contract</h4>\n<p>The monitoring is necessary for a contract (such as the employment contract) you have with the worker, or because they asked you to take specific steps before entering into a contract.</p>\n<p>You <strong>should only</strong> use this lawful basis if it is necessary for your side of the contract as an employer. Whilst scenarios may exist where the use of employee monitoring is the only way for you to fulfil your side of a contract, these are hard to envisage.</p>\n<p>As monitoring is more often for internal business improvement purposes, it\u2019s unlikely that it will be a suitable lawful basis for monitoring workers.</p>\n<div class=\"example\"><span class=\"button-circle\"><span class=\"icon-lightbulb-o\"></span></span>\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n<p>An employer inserts a clause into its employment contracts to say that it employs video surveillance across its premises to monitor productivity and improve efficiency. This would not be sufficient justification to use this lawful basis for such monitoring as there are other less intrusive ways of improving productivity.</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Legal obligation</h4>\n<p>The processing is necessary for you to comply with the law.</p>\n<p>You can rely on this lawful basis if you monitor workers to comply with a common law or statutory obligation. This does not apply to contractual obligations. In order to rely on this basis you <strong>must</strong> either identify the specific legal provision or an appropriate source of advice or guidance that clearly sets out your obligation.</p>\n<div class=\"example\"><span class=\"button-circle\"><span class=\"icon-lightbulb-o\"></span></span>\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n<p>A logistics company needs to monitor driving time, speed and distance to comply with the rules on drivers\u2019 working hours. Legal obligation is appropriate as a lawful basis. The logistics company documents the decision to rely on this lawful basis and signposts to the legislation which applies. The company does not process more information than necessary to fulfil obligations under the rules on drivers\u2019 hours. They also do not use the information for any other purposes.</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Vital interests</h4>\n<p>The processing is necessary to protect someone\u2019s life.</p>\n<p>This is for emergencies, where you need to process personal information to protect someone\u2019s life. This lawful basis is very limited in its scope and generally only applies to matters of life and death.</p>\n<div class=\"example\"><span class=\"button-circle\"><span class=\"icon-lightbulb-o\"></span></span>\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n<p>A test pilot is monitored for several important factors, such as heart rate, blood pressure and brain activity. These factors may change in the demanding and dangerous job of test flights. These are vital to make sure the pilot is kept safe. On the other hand, an office worker would not expect to be monitored for these things, as there would be little in their job that would affect these factors. It is likely that another lawful basis for monitoring would be more suitable.</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Public task</h4>\n<p>The processing is necessary for you to perform a task in the public interest or for your official functions.</p>\n<p>You <strong>must </strong>have a clear basis in law for the task or function. This is most relevant to public authorities, but it can apply to any organisation that exercises official authority or carries out tasks in the public interest that have a clear basis in law. For example, a private organisation or charity working under contract to a public authority to help deliver one of their defined legal functions.</p>\n<p>This basis may be appropriate if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you are a public authority or your organisation carries out tasks in the public interest; and</li>\n<li>you can demonstrate that monitoring workers is necessary to perform your tasks as set down in UK law.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You <strong>should</strong> assess the basis in law of the specific monitoring activity. You cannot rely on this basis if you could achieve the same purpose in a less intrusive way.</p>\n<p>If monitoring is not necessary for you to perform your public task then you cannot reply upon this lawful basis.</p>\n<h4>Legitimate interests</h4>\n<p>The processing is necessary for your legitimate interests or those of a third party, unless the risks to the workers\u2019 rights overrides them.</p>\n<p>This basis is the most flexible and could apply in a wide range of circumstances.</p>\n<p>Legitimate interests may not be the most appropriate lawful basis if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you are monitoring in ways workers do not understand and would not reasonably expect; or</li>\n<li>it is likely some workers would object if you explained it to them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You <strong>could</strong> use the DPIA process help you to assess this. (See the section on <a href=\"#dp11\" data-anchor=\"#dp11\">DPIAs</a>).</p>\n<p>Depending on the work they undertake, and the contexts they work in, workers can reasonably expect different levels of monitoring to fall within the legitimate interest definition</p>\n<div class=\"example\"><span class=\"button-circle\"><span class=\"icon-lightbulb-o\"></span></span>\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n<p>A miner would reasonably expect to wear a tracking device within a mine. This would be due to the dangerous work they undertake, the risks involved in potential accidents and the need to keep track of their location within the mine.</p>\n<p>However, an office worker would not reasonably expect to wear a tracking device in an office setting. There is far less risk working day-to-day in an office that a mine and office workers would not reasonably expect such a level of monitoring.</p>\n</div>\n<p>When deciding if the proposed monitoring is appropriate, you <strong>must</strong> balance your legitimate interests and the necessity of the monitoring against the interests, rights and freedoms of workers, considering the particular circumstances. This is different to the other lawful bases which presume that your interests and those of the worker are balanced.</p>\n<p>You can break the key elements of the legitimate interests basis down into a three-part test:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Purpose test</strong>\u2013 is there a legitimate interest behind the processing?</li>\n<li><strong>Necessity test</strong>\u2013 is the processing necessary for that purpose?</li>\n<li><strong>Balancing test</strong>\u2013 is the legitimate interest overridden by the person\u2019s interests, rights or freedoms?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You <strong>should </strong>assess each of the tests before processing and document the outcome, so you can demonstrate that legitimate interests applies. You <strong>should</strong> do this by carrying out a legitimate interests assessment.</p>\n<div class=\"greenBlock\">\n<p><strong>Further reading</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Please also see our separate <a rel=\"noopener\" data-udi=\"umb://document/6c0acf79cdb84aebba579ed90ca78ad6\" href=\"/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/a-guide-to-lawful-basis/lawful-basis-for-processing/#how\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Lawful basis for processing\" data-anchor=\"#how\" class=\"link-external\">lawful basis guidance<span class=\"invisible\"></span></a> for more general information about the different bases available.</li>\n<li>See also our <a rel=\"noopener\" data-udi=\"umb://document/f9f584f955e94c27957d1356a7c70510\" href=\"/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/legitimate-interests/how-do-we-apply-legitimate-interests-in-practice/#what_to_do\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"How do we apply legitimate interests in practice?\" data-anchor=\"#what_to_do\" class=\"link-external\">legitimate interest assessment<span class=\"invisible\"></span></a>, including a template you can use.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3>"

You may not plan to collect it, but the nature of the monitoring might make it likely (eg where monitoring may identify emails between a worker and a healthcare provider or a trade union representative).

In circumstances where you do not intend to capture special category data, but it's likely that you will do so, you <strong>should</strong> demonstrate that your purpose for monitoring outweighs the risk of inadvertently capturing special category data. The condition you choose <strong>should</strong> reflect this purpose. Carrying out a DPIA helps you do both of these things. (See the section on <a href=\"#dp11\" data-anchor=\"#dp11\">DPIAs</a>.)</p>\n<p>If you process, or are likely to process special category data, it is possible that the information you gather may be protected by other laws as well.

Explicit consent is not specifically defined by the UK GDPR but is similar to the lawful basis of consent. If you want to rely on this condition, you <strong>must</strong> ensure that workers provide explicit consent in a clear statement (whether written or oral). Explicit consent cannot be implied. To rely on this condition, you <strong>must</strong> ensure workers have a genuine option, with no negative impact (either actual or perceived) for withholding explicit consent. This is unlikely in most employment circumstances.

This is because employers want to secure their systems and manage remote workers.</p>\r\n<p>If you are monitoring workers remotely, you <strong>should</strong> keep in mind that workers\u2019 expectations of privacy are likely to be higher at home than in the workplace. The risks of capturing family and private life information are higher as you can inadvertently capture it. You <strong>should</strong> factor this risk into any type of monitoring of remote workers you intend to implement. You <strong>should</strong> do this as part of a DPIA.

The company limits recording to strictly what is required by those rules.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>You may have a business need to monitor usage, for example to detect calls to numbers you would not routinely expect workers to call. You <strong>could </strong>consider using itemised call records rather than recording call content. If the itemised call record alone is insufficient, you can assess whether you can use it to strictly limit and target any further monitoring. If you decide to change the way you monitor calls as a result of information you gather during call monitoring, you <strong>should </strong>revisit your DPIA and carefully consider the implications of increased levels of monitoring.</p>\r\n<div class=\"example\"><span class=\"button-circle\"><span class=\"icon-lightbulb-o\"></span></span>\r\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\r\n<p>A recruitment agency suspects workers are sharing commercial secrets with a competitor. The employer uses itemised call records to narrow down those under suspicion and then uses these records to target any further monitoring accordingly.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>You <strong>must</strong> make sure you inform workers of any call monitoring in your privacy information. You <strong>should</strong> also include this in any other relevant internal documents, such as your employment handbook, codes of conduct and guidance. You <strong>should</strong> ensure workers understand the purpose and extent of any monitoring.</p>\r\n<p>You <strong>should not </strong>routinely monitor personal calls. You might want to use information about personal calls for billing or in exceptional circumstances (eg suspected criminal activity). You <strong>should</strong> have a policy for personal calls and make sure workers are aware of this.</p>\r\n<p>Workers base their expectations of privacy on practice as well as policy. So if you tolerate a number of personal calls, you cannot rely on a policy banning them to justify carrying out this type of monitoring.</p>\r\n<p>Don\u2019t forget that worker\u2019s expectations of privacy are significantly higher at home or outside the workplace. You <strong>should</strong> factor this in to your DPIA.</p>\r\n<p>Monitoring calls also inevitably involves collecting information about people who make calls to, or receive calls from the organisation, as well as about workers themselves. You <strong>must </strong>tell these people that you are recording the call and why. A recorded message is good practice. Where this is not possible, you <strong>must </strong>instruct workers to inform callers that calls may be recorded and to explain the reason why. You can then provide the rest of the privacy information (eg retention periods, individual rights available, and details of any data sharing) by other means. For example, you <strong>could</strong> email the caller a copy of your privacy information or provide a link to it on your website. Any information you collect is likely to be personal information and you <strong>could</strong> disclose it in response to a SAR.

However, many organisations also have video surveillance with audio capability, or have recording devices available in meeting rooms and many video conferencing apps also have the capability to record audio.

You <strong>should</strong> switch off by default any capability to record audio. You <strong>should only</strong> use it in exceptional circumstances, for example by a trigger switch. Continuous audio and video recording can be highly intrusive and you are unlikely to be able to justify it in most circumstances.</p>\r\n<p>You <strong>should</strong> target any monitoring at areas of particular risk and confine it to areas where expectations of privacy are low.

This system uses biometric data to identify individual workers so the employer needs a valid condition for processing special category data in addition to a lawful basis.</p>\n<p>The employer offers a swipe card option with no detriment to workers who do not wish to have their fingerprints scanned. This means the employer can consider relying on the explicit consent condition for processing the special category biometric data. This is because workers can give their consent freely and have the option to use a swipe card if they change their mind.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"example\"><span class=\"button-circle\"><span class=\"icon-lightbulb-o\"></span></span>\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n<p>An employer rolls out new laptops to all workers. The devices have the option of facial recognition sign in. Staff who have tested the system find the facial recognition feature very useful. The employer decides to use consent as their lawful basis.</p>\n<p>Workers who agree to using facial recognition provide explicit consent on the understanding that the image created is only held on the device provided to them and is not stored elsewhere or used for any other purpose than device access. Workers who do not wish to use facial recognition to log on may use a password or a PIN instead. The facial recognition process does not initiate on the laptops of workers who have not given consent.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"example\"><span class=\"button-circle\"><span class=\"icon-lightbulb-o\"></span></span>\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n<p>A manager at a factory has made some suggestions they believe will improve security. They recommend installing facial recognition scanners on their factory doors to allow workers to access and \u2018clock in and out\u2019 of the factory floor. The company decides to rely on consent as their lawful basis for implementing the facial recognition technology.</p>\n<p>The company conducted a Data Protection Impact Assessment which looked into the options under data protection legislation, security and health and safety logs and input from factory staff. The company concludes that they cannot demonstrate it is entirely necessary or proportionate to use facial recognition on all of their workers. The company cannot rely on consent as the lawful basis or condition of processing, as the proposed system offers no alternative method of access for the workers \u2013 their consent would not be meaningful.</p>\n<p>After giving the matter further consideration, the factory offers swipe cards to their employees who do not want to use facial recognition. This means that consent is now a viable legal basis to rely on, as an alternative has been offered to the workers.</p>\n</div>\n<h3><span>"

        "content": "<a id=\"can7\"></a>What about accuracy, fairness and rights relating to automated decision making?</h3>\n<p>Any inaccuracies in biometric data that allow workers to access work or to pay them correctly are likely to have a detrimental impact on workers. When deciding whether to implement a new system, you <strong>should </strong>think carefully about the accuracy of the system and its ability to correctly identify people. As a data controller, it is your responsibility to ensure personal information stored on your system is accurate regardless of whether you have engaged another organisation to provide the system. You <strong>should</strong> make sure systems are in place to quickly correct any inaccurate information so it does not negatively impact workers. You <strong>must</strong> consider the type of biometric you are looking to collect (for example fingerprints or facial scans) and consider whether it is appropriate for your use-case. You <strong>should</strong> continually monitor the performance of your system as well as complaints you get from staff to make performance changes to the system.</p>\n<p>There is a risk that facial recognition works with less precision for some demographic groups. To comply with the fairness principle, you <strong>must</strong> assess and mitigate the bias in your system. If you have engaged another organisation to provide the system, you <strong>should</strong> check it is suitable for the groups and people whose information it will capture. If the system you use results in processing which causes bias or discrimination, you are likely to breach the fairness principle.</p>\n<p><span>Accuracy is linked to workers\u2019 rights about automated decision-making and profiling. If monitoring workers relies on authentication by solely automated decision-making, there is a risk that workers are incorrectly identified or not identified at all. You <strong>must</strong> ensure that manual reviews are therefore available if an automatic process has resulted in a possible access denial. You <strong>must</strong> give workers the option to ask for a review if they are unhappy with a decision made by solely automated processing. You <strong>should</strong> quickly identify issues with workers accessing systems or buildings and give back access to workers as soon as possible. You <strong>should not</strong> disadvantage workers who request manual reviews.</span></p>\n<div class=\"example\"><span class=\"button-circle\"><span class=\"icon-lightbulb-o\"></span></span>\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n<p>Access to a building is controlled by facial recognition. A worker with full access permissions stands in front of the camera but the door fails to open as the system has not recognised them. This means the worker cannot start work.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this risk, the employer has also installed an intercom so the worker can quickly call a supervisor who can grant them entry and manually enter the time they arrived into the system.</p>\n<p><span>If an alternative had not been in place, the worker could potentially have suffered negative consequences, such as loss of pay or disciplinary action. The intervention by the supervisor means that the worker experiences a minor inconvenience rather than a significant detriment as a result of the facial recognition access control system.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"greenBlock\">\n<p><strong>Further reading</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>See also our guidance on <a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-dp-themes/guidance-on-video-surveillance-including-cctv/additional-considerations-for-technologies-other-than-cctv/\">video surveillance</a>.</li>\n<li><span><a rel=\"noopener\" data-udi=\"umb://document/f4c7dc58d4b443b9970cccf7e3910aee\" href=\"/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/artificial-intelligence/guidance-on-ai-and-data-protection/how-do-we-ensure-fairness-in-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"How do we ensure fairness in AI?\" class=\"link-external\">How do we ensure fairness in AI?<span class=\"invisible\"></span></a></span></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3>"
